{"id":"ultimate_bug_scanner-2mro","title":"Feature: Publish toon_rust as library crate to crates.io","description":"## Overview\n\nPublish toon_rust to crates.io as a library crate with both lib and bin targets, enabling Rust projects to use TOON encoding/decoding without spawning a subprocess.\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently toon_rust is only available as a binary (`tru`). This works for CLI tools and bash scripts, but Rust projects that want TOON support must:\n1. Shell out to the binary (subprocess overhead)\n2. Parse stdout/stderr (fragile)\n3. Handle binary availability (may not be installed)\n\nA library crate solves all these issues.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```rust\n// lib.rs\npub fn encode(json: &str) -> Result<String, ToonError>;\npub fn encode_value(value: &serde_json::Value) -> Result<String, ToonError>;\npub fn decode(toon: &str) -> Result<String, ToonError>;\npub fn decode_value(toon: &str) -> Result<serde_json::Value, ToonError>;\n\n// With options\npub fn encode_with_options(json: &str, opts: EncodeOptions) -> Result<String, ToonError>;\n\npub struct EncodeOptions {\n    pub delimiter: Delimiter,      // Comma, Tab, Pipe\n    pub indent: usize,             // Default 2\n    pub key_folding: KeyFolding,   // Off, Safe\n    pub flatten_depth: Option<usize>,\n}\n```\n\n## Cargo.toml Structure\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"toon\"\nversion = \"0.2.0\"\n\n[lib]\nname = \"toon\"\npath = \"src/lib.rs\"\n\n[[bin]]\nname = \"tru\"\npath = \"src/main.rs\"\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```rust\nuse toon::{encode, decode};\n\nlet json = r#\"{\"name\": \"test\", \"values\": [1, 2, 3]}\"#;\nlet toon_output = encode(json)?;\nlet roundtrip = decode(&toon_output)?;\nassert_eq!(json, roundtrip);\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **No subprocess overhead** - Direct function calls\n2. **Type safety** - Rust error handling\n3. **Composability** - Use in pipelines, iterators\n4. **Testability** - Unit test TOON encoding in Rust projects\n5. **Discoverability** - Found via crates.io search\n\n## Migration Path\n\n- Existing binary users: No change (bin target still works)\n- New Rust projects: `cargo add toon` and use library API\n- UBS: Could optionally include as dependency if rewritten in Rust\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone - can be done independently.\n\n## Notes\n\nThis work happens in the toon_rust repository.\nConsider whether to rename the crate from `toon_rust` to just `toon`.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-24T07:01:31.624598652Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-24T15:35:31.162950655Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["crates-io","feature","library","toon"]}

{"id":"ultimate_bug_scanner-3a6","title":"Epic: Automate toon_rust binary installation in UBS installer","description":"## Overview\n\nThe UBS installer (`install.sh`) must automatically download and install the toon_rust `tru` binary as part of the standard installation process. Users should NOT need to manually:\n- Download toon_rust\n- Build from source\n- Set TOON_TRU_BIN/TOON_BIN environment variable\n- Configure shell profiles\n\nEverything must be fully automated, just like ast-grep, ripgrep, and jq installations are today.\n\n## Background & Rationale\n\n### Current State\n- UBS supports `--format=toon` for ~50% smaller output (optimized for LLM token efficiency)\n- TOON encoding uses the toon_rust `tru` binary (Node.js toon CLI is not permitted)\n- User must manually set `TOON_TRU_BIN=/path/to/tru` to force the fast Rust version\n- This friction means most users miss the fast Rust encoder by default\n\n### Why This Matters\n- toon_rust is ~10x faster than the Node.js implementation\n- No Node.js runtime dependency required\n- Consistent with UBS philosophy: batteries-included, zero-config\n- TOON format is critical for AI/LLM workflows where token efficiency matters\n\n### Naming Conflict Issue\n- Original toon_rust binary name conflicted with the Unix translate command\n- Solution: use the `tru` binary name everywhere and install as `tru` in ~/.local/bin\n- UBS already sets `TOON_TRU_BIN`, so the binary name is abstracted away\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. Fresh UBS install automatically downloads platform-appropriate toon_rust binary\n2. Binary installed to ~/.local/bin/tru (or platform equivalent)\n3. TOON_TRU_BIN automatically configured (shell profile or ubs internal default)\n4. `ubs --format=toon` works out-of-box with Rust encoder\n5. No Node.js fallback (only toon_rust)\n6. Works on Linux (x86_64, arm64) and macOS (x86_64, arm64)\n\n## Architecture Notes\n- Follow existing patterns from install.sh (see ast-grep, ripgrep, jq downloads)\n- Use GitHub releases for binary distribution\n- Verify checksums for security\n- Support --dry-run for testing","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-24T06:51:33.356904216Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-24T15:46:46.334570655Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["automation","epic","installer","toon"]}
