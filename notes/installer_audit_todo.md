### 1. TypeScript Fixtures & Manifest (46h)
- [x] Re-read new TS fixtures (buggy/clean) for correctness + clarity (verified guard/exit semantics on 2025-11-17).
- [x] Confirm manifest entries assert expected counts for new category (js-type-narrowing cases pass via `uv run`).
- [x] Update `test-suite/README.md` fixtures + expected output table (documented TS + cross-language rows).
- [x] Document CLI flag/manifest guidance in `README.md` or dedicated section (README already covers `--skip-type-narrowing`; sanity checked).

### 2. Installer + CLI Skip Flag (dit)
- [x] Audit CLI `--skip-type-narrowing` plumbing (env var, config, help text) end-to-end (config + help updated 2025-11-17).
- [x] Ensure installer + diagnostics honor skip flag (TypeScript readiness logging no longer trips `set -e`).
- [x] Extend installer dry-run/logging coverage for new routines. *(npm install helper + readiness block respect dry-run.)*
- [x] Add `--self-test` follow-up coverage (installer harness now runs a dedicated `--self-test` regression unless invoked recursively).
- [x] Refresh README/INSTALL docs for diagnostics + skip flag usage (README safety-net/table updated with Node/TypeScript note).

### 3. Cross-language Heuristics (8d7)
- [x] Validate new Rust helper + fixtures; ensure manifest/test coverage (helper handles single files; JS/Rust cases pass via `uv run`).
- [x] Investigate Kotlin (or other language) heuristic feasibility + design plan.
- [x] Hook optional rules into CLI config/flags (parallel to TS case).
- [x] Update docs to mention multi-language coverage & how to toggle.
- [x] Evaluate migrating the Rust helper to ast-grep rules (Bash wrapper now collects ast-grep JSON and feeds the helper, with regex fallback when ast-grep/python unavailable).

### 4. Typos Spellchecker Integration
- [x] Confirm `install_typos` handles macOS/Linux/Windows, dry-run, retries (binary download + brew/cargo paths verified).
- [x] Add detection logic + diagnostics (installer + verification now report Typos status/skips).
- [x] Provide `--skip-typos` flag/config + documentation (README safety-net table + flag wiring updated).
- [x] Extend smoke tests to exercise Typos install/skip paths (installer harness updated with regression coverage).

### 5. Installer Reliability + UX
- [x] Review locking/tempfile helpers (self-test releases locks; harness ensures no stray `/tmp/ubs-install.lock`).
- [x] Ensure cleanup only deletes tracked temp paths; add coverage in tests. *(WORKDIR override + safe removal guard + harness asserts workdir cleanup.)*
- [x] Polish log formatting + section headings (consistent emojis/colors?). *(log_section now prints framed titles.)*
- [x] Improve `install.sh --help` text (options grouped, new flags described).
- [x] Add PATH shadow warning and summary reminder (post-install `warn_if_stale_binary` now runs; consider further summary polish).

### 6. Test Coverage & Tooling
- [x] Fix `test-suite/install/run_tests.sh` to accommodate new diagnostics + Typos (captures exit code + tolerates readiness probe).
- [x] Run entire install test suite locally (CI parity) and capture output (`bash test-suite/install/run_tests.sh`).
- [x] Execute UBS manifest or targeted tests for new fixtures (JS/Rust type narrowing cases run via `uv`).
- [x] Run `ubs .` (or scoped) after code changes per AGENTS.md. *(./ubs --ci . run 2025-11-18; warnings 0 after async helper + JSON heuristics refinements.)*

### 7. Fresh-Eyes Review & Follow-ups
- [x] Re-read modified installer + module code for obvious bugs/regressions.
- [x] File new beads for any follow-up work discovered mid-review *(none identified during this pass).* 
- [x] Summarize findings + scanner results in final handoff (documented in 2025-11-18 status reply).

### 8. Instant Confidence Onboarding (ir4)
- [x] Capture readiness facts (ripgrep/jq/typos/type narrowing) during installer run and feed into session summary bullet list.
- [x] Include last `ubs doctor` exit status + pointer to session log path in completion banner.
- [x] Implement `ubs sessions` (or `ubs session-log`) subcommand:
  - [x] Show tail of `~/.config/ubs/session.md` with optional `--entries`/`--raw` flags.
  - [x] Respect `NO_COLOR` and provide helpful error if log absent.
- [x] Installer: mention new CLI command in quickstart text + README.
- [x] Test: extend `test-suite/install/run_tests.sh` to stub HOME, run installer with `--skip-doctor` false, then assert `ubs sessions --entries 1` prints latest block without error (maybe by invoking CLI script with env pointing to temp config).

### 9. Type Narrowing Full Coverage (4se)
- [x] Kotlin helper: add coroutine/optional-chain awareness (e.g., guard `if (job?.isActive == true)` before `job!!`).
- [x] Swift helper: detect optional chaining misuse (guard `if foo?.bar != nil` then later `foo!.bar`), and bridging cases.
- [x] Add fixtures under `test-suite/kotlin/type_narrowing/` and `test-suite/swift/type_narrowing/` for new heuristics; update manifest counts accordingly.
- [x] README/test-suite docs: new Swift/Kotlin coverage table row plus CLI flag mention.
- [x] UBS CLI help text: mention cross-language coverage + `--skip-type-narrowing` effects (ensuring help section includes languages).
- [x] Tests: run targeted manifest cases + `test-suite/run_all.sh` to verify metrics.

### 10. Java Lifecycle AST Coverage (6x4)
- [x] Generate ast-grep rules for ExecutorService shutdown, raw Thread join, and JDBC connection close detection.
- [x] Wire `emit_ast_rule_group` + shared AST result caching into `ubs-java.sh` so resource heuristics use AST first with regex fallback.
- [x] Keep manifest expectations stable (java-resource-lifecycle) via summary strings + new rule IDs.

### 11. Python Resource Helper (41t)
- [x] Enhance `resource_lifecycle_py.py` to understand `with/async with`, alias imports, and attribute `.open()` / `.connect()` patterns (pathlib, DB handles, etc.).
- [x] Ensure helper output powers Category 19 so regex heuristics are only a fallback when Python 3 or the helper file is unavailable.
- [x] Update fixtures/docs to note the AST-driven detection and re-run manifest suites.

### 12. Universal AST Adoption (7g7)
- [x] Document the AST coverage story in README (JS/TS, Python, Go, C++, Rust, Java, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin) so the epic has a single source of truth.
- [x] Verify every language module now has AST-powered detectors for its flagship categories (type narrowing, resource lifecycle, taint/async errors) with regex only as a fallback.
- [x] Re-run `test-suite/run_all.sh` + `./ubs --ci .` to prove the AST stack is stable across languages.

### 13. Docs & Polish Follow-ups (new)
- [x] Expand README + test-suite docs with concrete Go/Python resource lifecycle examples (buggy vs clean snippets + helper output narrations).
- [x] Ensure CLI and README help text highlight the AST-backed lifecycle coverage + `ubs sessions` workflow where appropriate.
- [x] Investigate `go-resource-lifecycle` manifest expectations to assert on deterministic helper output (add/restore specific substrings if missing).
- [x] Housekeeping: verify helpers/installers leave no `__pycache__` or stray temp directories; document guardrails if needed (checked 2025-11-18 via find/installer harness cleanup).
- [x] After changes, run a fresh-eyes pass on installer + Go/Python modules before scans/tests.

### 14. JDBC Lifecycle Follow-ups (java-resource expansion)
- [ ] Extend ast-grep coverage to Statements/PreparedStatements (new `java.resource.statement-no-close` rule) + metadata entries.
- [ ] Update Java fixtures (buggy + clean) to exercise Statement, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet leaks vs. guarded patterns.
- [ ] Expand manifest `java-resource-lifecycle` expectations to assert on new summary strings.
- [ ] Refresh README resource-lifecycle bullet to mention Statement/PreparedStatement coverage.
- [ ] Re-run Java manifest + full `test-suite/run_all.sh` + `./ubs --ci .`; document outcomes.
