## [v5.3.4] - 2026-07-06 [Release]

### Fixes

- **#60 — each language module is now bounded by a per-module `timeout` and its process group is reaped, eliminating whole-scan hangs.** A single misbehaving module (e.g. a `ripgrep`/helper subprocess that stalled or spawned children) could previously wedge the entire scan indefinitely. The meta-runner now runs every language module under `timeout`, tears down the module's full process group on exit, and reports a distinct `MODULE_TIMEOUT` result instead of blocking forever, so one slow language can no longer take down the run.
- **#58 — `install.sh` no longer aborts the install when the pre-commit hook cannot be set up outside a real git repo**, and the hook is now written to git's real hooks directory (honoring worktrees and `core.hooksPath`) rather than a hardcoded `.git/hooks` path.

### Housekeeping

- `VERSION`, `UBS_VERSION` (in `ubs`), and the README version badge bumped to `5.3.4`; `SHA256SUMS` refreshed against the bumped `ubs` bytes.

---

## [v5.3.2] - 2026-05-24

### Fixes

- **#51 follow-up — two more source-scanning count pipelines now honor `// ubs:ignore`.** Second-pass fresh-eyes review found two further bypass sites that v5.3.0 / v5.3.1 missed: `modules/ubs-golang.sh` "exec shell interpreter" rg-fallback (cat 5 SECURITY — pipes `rg ... | wc -l` directly, ignoring per-line markers), and `modules/ubs-swift.sh` "URLSession task creation sites" (cat 14 NETWORKING — strips line content via `awk -F: '{print $1":"$2}' | sort -u | wc -l` for unique-tuple counting, so `// ubs:ignore` in the content was dropped before any counter could see it). Golang fix pipes through `count_lines()`; Swift fix inserts `grep -v 'ubs:ignore'` BEFORE the content-stripping awk so the marker has a chance to filter. `MODULE_CHECKSUMS` (golang, swift) and `SHA256SUMS` refreshed.

---

## [v5.3.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixes

- **#51 follow-up — three additional source-scanning count pipelines now route through `count_lines()`.** Fresh-eyes review of the v5.3.0 sweep found three source-scanning pipelines that still went through `grep -c` / `grep -Ec` and silently ignored per-line `// ubs:ignore` / `# ubs:ignore` markers: `modules/ubs-swift.sh` "String += in loops" (cat 17 PERFORMANCE), `modules/ubs-swift.sh` "sleep/usleep in tests" (cat 21 TESTING), and `modules/ubs-rust.sh` "todo!/unimplemented! in tests" (cat 11 TESTS & BENCHES). All three now use `count_lines()`; the trailing `awk 'END{print $0+0}'` post-processor is replaced with `${count:-0}`. `MODULE_CHECKSUMS` (rust, swift) and `SHA256SUMS` refreshed.

---

## [v5.3.0] - 2026-05-24

### Fixes

- **#51 — `ubs:ignore` now respected by every count pipeline.** PR #24 introduced the `count_lines()` helper that strips per-line `// ubs:ignore` / `# ubs:ignore` markers, but a subset of rules in 6 language modules piped their `GREP_RN` output straight through `grep -c` / `grep -cw`, bypassing the helper. Those rules silently ignored the marker. This release routes every source-scanning count through `count_lines()`. 21 bypass patterns fixed across `ubs-js.sh` (7), `ubs-python.sh` (8), `ubs-java.sh` (3 unique × 7 duplicates from copy-pasted templates = 10 lines), `ubs-cpp.sh` (2), `ubs-golang.sh` (1), and `ubs-swift.sh` (1). Tool-output counters (cargo audit log, xcodebuild output, mix dialyzer output, SARIF JSON, Cargo.toml section headers) are intentionally left as `grep -c` since `ubs:ignore` is not meaningful there.

### Features

- **#52 — per-language `--skip-LANG=N` plus loud warning on ambiguous bare `--skip=N`.** Category numbers are NOT stable across language modules — `--skip=8` silences `FUNCTION & SCOPE ISSUES` in JS but `SECURITY FINDINGS` (critical TLS bypass, hardcoded secrets) in Rust. Two changes ship together:
  - **New flag `--skip-LANG=N[,M,...]`** silences categories in one language module only. `LANG` accepts the same aliases as `--only` / `--exclude` (e.g. `--skip-c=5`, `--skip-cs=8`, `--skip-ex=4`). Bare `--skip=N` still applies globally for backwards compatibility; the two combine into a single `--skip=` CSV per module.
  - **Stderr warning on ambiguous bare `--skip=N`.** When bare `--skip=N` is used AND two or more language modules will run, UBS now prints a stderr warning that names what category `N` maps to in each active module and recommends the `--skip-LANG=N` form. Single-language runs (`--only=js --skip=8`) stay quiet; per-language flag use stays quiet. Built on top of an embedded category-name lookup harvested from each module's `print_header "N. NAME"` lines.

### Tests

- New regression suite `test-suite/shareable/test_skip_categories.py` (wired into `run_all.sh`) covers all four scenarios:
  - #51 `Function declarations in blocks` rule: fires baseline, suppressed when every matching line carries `// ubs:ignore`.
  - #52 single-language `--skip=N`: no warning.
  - #52 polyglot `--skip=N`: warning emitted, names cat per language.
  - #52 `--skip-LANG=N`: only the target module is affected; Python's critical `Mutable default arguments` (cat 8) keeps firing when only `--skip-js=8` is set.

### Representative commits

- **Latest tag:** [`6cb0180`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/6cb0180) tracks destructured TypeScript route params as SQL taint sources.
- **Latest GitHub Release:** [`v5.2.61`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/releases/tag/v5.2.61) is the newest published release asset set observed during reconstruction.
- **Rust SQL taint:** [`3fc8537`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/3fc8537) detects request-derived SQL injection in Rust.
- **Go SQL taint:** [`933f440`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/933f440) treats `PathValue` route parameters as tainted SQL sources.
- **Cross-language header injection:** [`c554c3e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/c554c3e) closes the response-header injection wave with C++ coverage and clearer TOON encoder errors.

### Rust Detector Expansion

UBS gained a broad Rust audit wave before the later cross-language security packs. This work moved the Rust module beyond obvious panics and unwraps into protocol and trust-boundary bugs that commonly appear in agent-written web services and CLI tools.

**Delivered capability**

- Detect request-derived SQL injection in raw query construction, including later placeholder-aware fixes so tainted SQL text is still flagged when a call uses bind placeholders ([`3fc8537`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/3fc8537)).
- Detect credentialed wildcard CORS and JWT verification bypass or insufficient issuer/audience binding ([`88e881c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/88e881c), [`d23de5d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/d23de5d), [`c10266b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/c10266b)).
- Detect archive extraction path traversal and predictable temp-file writes ([`4a63349`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/4a63349), [`96146c1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/96146c1)).
- Detect request-derived SSRF URLs, open redirects, response header injection, and path traversal sources shared with the larger web-security family ([`a8d859f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/a8d859f), [`968fb3a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/968fb3a), [`9d54688`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/9d54688)).
- Add Rust-specific bug patterns for iterator/unsafe-API filtering, panic-prone `Drop`, direct indexing panic surfaces, command/path trust boundaries, and unsafe initialization APIs ([`fb7a68f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/fb7a68f), [`85b39c1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/85b39c1), [`86105bc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/86105bc), [`8c39136`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/8c39136), [`d12814a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/d12814a), [`b8b04a1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/b8b04a1)).

**Closed workstreams**

- Lightweight taint analysis (`ultimate_bug_scanner-4jg`).
- Async error path coverage (`ultimate_bug_scanner-e3j`).
- Type-narrowing and resource lifecycle helper expansion (`ultimate_bug_scanner-4se`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-4sm`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-8d7`).

### JavaScript and TypeScript Detector Expansion

The JS/TS module received the densest single-language expansion: browser API misuse, Node/Express trust boundaries, cancellation leaks, token validation, route-parameter taint, and AST-backed false-positive controls.

**Delivered capability**

- Detect browser trust-boundary bugs such as unsafe `window.open` targets, unsafe JSX blank targets, unsanitized React HTML sinks, wildcard `postMessage` origins, and missing origin checks ([`df1a38f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/df1a38f), [`8a8e9b5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/8a8e9b5), [`b2e8509`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/b2e8509), [`11651c6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/11651c6), [`9fb2788`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/9fb2788)).
- Add async callback misuse coverage for React effects, `forEach`, `map`, array predicates, timers, `addEventListener`, `new Promise`, EventEmitter listeners, sort/flatMap/reduce callbacks, direct `await` on `map(async ...)`, `Promise.all` over `forEach`, and async JSX handlers ([`5b679ec`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/5b679ec), [`9761a4d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/9761a4d), [`fe4254d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/fe4254d), [`1fc0b34`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/1fc0b34), [`e153597`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/e153597), [`144a80c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/144a80c)).
- Add web security detectors for JWT verification bypass, insecure cookies, credentialed wildcard CORS, randomness, disabled TLS verification, SSRF, response header injection, open redirect, archive extraction traversal, and filesystem path traversal ([`2c81897`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/2c81897), [`79aa5ac`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/79aa5ac), [`ed9fcbd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/ed9fcbd), [`cb47d26`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/cb47d26), [`8f3633a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/8f3633a), [`f2d7477`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/f2d7477)).
- Add TypeScript-specific prototype-pollution, proxy-target SSRF, raw SQL injection, and destructured route-parameter taint propagation ([`f3c36ec`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/f3c36ec), [`5c8f4b8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/5c8f4b8), [`039e94e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/039e94e), [`0a77f0a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/0a77f0a), [`6cb0180`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/6cb0180)).

**Closed workstreams**

- TS server narrowing analyzer (`ultimate_bug_scanner-stk`).
- JS/TS AST scanning guarantee and high-severity AST confirmation (`ultimate_bug_scanner-js-ts-ast-guarantee`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-js-highsev-ast-confirm`).
- JS global-pollution false-positive follow-up (`ultimate_bug_scanner-js-global-pollution-fp-fix2`).

### Python Web-Security Pack

Python coverage expanded from general static checks into framework-aware request/response flows. The detector set now covers bugs that appear in Flask, Django, FastAPI, Starlette-style middleware, `requests`/HTTPX integrations, CSV/Excel export paths, and upload handling.

**Delivered capability**

- Detect Python request-derived open redirects, path traversal, SSRF-prone outbound URLs, JWT verification bypasses, interpolated SQL sinks, and command-injection dataflow ([`7bbee86`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/7bbee86), [`b4c9cbb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/b4c9cbb), [`1f3d436`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/1f3d436), [`ed1c12f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/ed1c12f), [`0822f25`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/0822f25), [`3308c97`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/3308c97)).
- Add unsafe deserialization, missing HTTP timeout, unsafe upload path, cookie/CORS, response-header injection, Host-header poisoning, template/NoSQL/LDAP/email-header injection, and subprocess-timeout families ([`4e3b29e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/4e3b29e), [`03314a5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/03314a5), [`a73be83`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/a73be83), [`ad51dba`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/ad51dba), [`8cb3c8d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/8cb3c8d), [`e911430`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/e911430), [`9fbf35a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/9fbf35a), [`906edf6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/906edf6)).
- Improve helper-driven Python resource lifecycle analysis through AST migration and follow-up fixes, then propagate checksum updates so installed scanners accepted the helper changes.

**Closed workstreams**

- Python resource helper and lifecycle AST migration (`ultimate_bug_scanner-41t`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-mma`).
- Bandit `.ubsignore` forwarding and test coverage (`ultimate_bug_scanner-2yvh`).

### Cross-Language Web Vulnerability Families

After the single-language Rust, JS/TS, and Python waves, UBS moved into repeated cross-language vulnerability families. The project pattern became: introduce one detector family, add intentionally buggy and clean fixtures, update the manifest, then regenerate module checksums.

**Delivered capability**

- **Archive extraction traversal:** Python, Go, Java, Ruby, C#, Swift, C++, Elixir, Kotlin, JS/TS, and Rust received zip-slip style extraction checks ([`75ea78c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/75ea78c), [`008f1ef`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/008f1ef), [`0cae370`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/0cae370), [`78c8f4e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/78c8f4e)).
- **Request-derived path traversal:** JS/TS, Python, Go, C/C++, Java, Ruby, C#, Swift, Elixir, and Kotlin now recognize common request/header/route-derived filesystem sinks ([`f2d7477`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/f2d7477), [`39e40d7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/39e40d7), [`876b87a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/876b87a), [`d6ae4de`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/d6ae4de), [`817c395`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/817c395)).
- **SSRF:** Go, Java/Kotlin, Ruby, C#, Swift, Elixir, C/C++, Rust, and JS/TS picked up request-derived outbound URL detection, including host/header sources and reverse proxy target flows ([`5310071`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/5310071), [`6c96eeb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/6c96eeb), [`64a6a22`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/64a6a22), [`a8d859f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/a8d859f), [`868a781`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/868a781)).
- **Open redirects:** C/C++, Elixir, Swift, Ruby, C#, Java/Kotlin, Go, Rust, Python, and JS/TS now detect request-derived redirect targets ([`f66395a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/f66395a), [`867146e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/867146e), [`42aa7ca`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/42aa7ca), [`5fadcc3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/5fadcc3)).
- **Response header injection:** Rust, Go, Java/Kotlin, C#, Ruby, Swift, Elixir, C/C++, and JS/TS received request-derived header sink detection, plus follow-up fixes for multiline Java/Kotlin sinks ([`9d54688`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/9d54688), [`3e0ef11`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/3e0ef11), [`b78839c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/b78839c), [`ccff15c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/ccff15c), [`c554c3e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/c554c3e)).

**Closed workstreams**

- Lightweight taint analysis (`ultimate_bug_scanner-4jg`) provided the underlying model for many of these request-derived sink rules.
- Resource lifecycle and type narrowing packs continued supplying helper coverage for languages where pure regex is too noisy.

### Secrets, Randomness, JWT, CORS, and Cookie Hardening

The next security wave targeted classes where simple grep is usually noisy unless narrowed by context: hardcoded credentials, security-sensitive randomness, secret comparisons, JWT parse/decode misuse, issuer/audience validation, cookie settings, and credentialed CORS.

**Delivered capability**

- Detect security-sensitive non-crypto randomness in Elixir, Ruby, Java/Kotlin, C#, Swift, C/C++, JS/TS, and related fixtures ([`2911f58`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/2911f58), [`054d692`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/054d692), [`41c507b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/41c507b), [`a0f1e25`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/a0f1e25)).
- Add hardcoded-secret detectors and environment-fallback follow-ups for JS/TS, Elixir, Rust, Go, Java/Kotlin, Ruby, Swift, and C# ([`1044a09`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/1044a09), [`f72212b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/f72212b), [`c39b4b2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/c39b4b2), [`cdb6ffe`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/cdb6ffe)).
- Detect non-constant secret comparisons in JS/TS, Go, and Rust ([`7ad487e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/7ad487e), [`61639f3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/61639f3), [`1eb42a3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/1eb42a3)).
- Add JWT parse/decode verification bypass and issuer/audience binding checks for Go, Rust, and JS/TS ([`52be770`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/52be770), [`d23de5d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/d23de5d), [`c823e4f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/c823e4f), [`8a61546`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/8a61546)).
- Expand credentialed wildcard CORS and insecure auth/session cookie checks in JS/TS, Go, Rust, and Python ([`ed9fcbd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/ed9fcbd), [`2e44bb5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/2e44bb5), [`872ddeb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/872ddeb), [`88e881c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/88e881c)).

### SQL Injection and Route-Parameter Taint Follow-Up

The latest tag-only slice (`v5.2.68` - `v5.2.75`) focused on request-derived SQL injection in Rust, Go, and TypeScript. This is the newest capability area and should be inspected first when cutting the next GitHub Release.

**Delivered capability**

- TypeScript raw SQL detection now tracks tainted strings from request parameters, including destructured route params and `params.<name>` patterns common in modern app routers ([`039e94e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/039e94e), [`0a77f0a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/0a77f0a), [`6cb0180`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/6cb0180)).
- Go SQL injection detection now treats `r.PathValue(...)`, request fields, and related request-derived values as tainted SQL sources; follow-up fixes preserve detection even when placeholders are present ([`933f440`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/933f440), [`6c45624`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/6c45624), [`bb9e705`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/bb9e705)).
- Rust SQL injection detection catches request-derived raw query construction and placeholder-masked tainted SQL strings ([`3fc8537`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/3fc8537)).

### Runner, Installer, Output, and Integrity Work

While detector coverage expanded, the project also hardened distribution and agent-facing operation.

**Delivered capability**

- Pin module fetches to the installed release tag after the `v5.1.2` checksum mismatch regression, while preserving update checks against the current upstream version ([`v5.1.2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/releases/tag/v5.1.2)).
- Keep module and helper SHA-256 checksums current after detector/helper edits; later work added version/tag drift checks and release closeout scripts.
- Add TOON output and `tru` integration with graceful fallback, plus README/help updates for token-efficient agent consumption.
- Improve CLI UX and automation surfaces such as `--version`, JSONL output, and Beads export helper behavior.
- Expand installer handling for `ast-grep` requirements, checksum auto-fix, install smoke tests, and secure distribution documentation.

**Closed workstreams**

- Runner and installer compatibility (`ultimate_bug_scanner-fbq`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-install-ast-grep-required`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-e3m`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-6q2`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-fln`).
- TOON output and encoder integration (`ultimate_bug_scanner-1tc`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-2kp`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-9vy`, `ultimate_bug_scanner-psu`).
- Release workflow and supply-chain docs (`ultimate_bug_scanner-1de`), with secure distribution work still tracked separately as in progress.

### Notes for Future Agents

- Do not infer release status from tags. `v5.2.75` is the newest tag; `v5.2.61` is the newest GitHub Release at the time of this update.
- The recent version train is intentionally granular: most tags represent one detector slice plus fixtures, manifest updates, version bump, and checksum refresh.
- For a release cut after this changelog, inspect `v5.2.62...v5.2.75` first because those commits are tag-only and not yet represented by GitHub Release assets.
- The Beads tracker captures the larger workstreams; the newest detector slices are mostly evidenced directly by git commits and tags.

## [v5.1.2] - 2026-04-25 **[Release]**

### Bug fix

- **Module fetch URL pinned to release tag instead of `main`** — every installed copy of UBS broke as soon as `main` advanced past the release the user had installed (issue #43). The launcher pins per-language module checksums, but `REPO_RAW` pointed at `main/modules/…`, so the moment any module changed on `main` the checksum verification rejected the download and the scanner refused to start. Fixed by pinning `REPO_RAW` to `v${UBS_VERSION}/…` for module/helper fetches while keeping the self-update probe on `main` (so stale installs still discover newer releases). Resolves the "expected `<pin>`, got `<current main>`" failure reported on macOS / Homebrew installs.

## [v5.0.6] - 2026-01-05 **[Release]**

> Title: "Documentation Deep-Dive"

### AST Rule Architecture Documentation

Added 201 lines of technical deep-dive documentation covering scanner internals that were previously undocumented:

- AST rule architecture with ancestor-aware pattern matching and the critical `stopBy: end` directive for ast-grep rules ([`2b632f0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/2b632f0aadb6e7aa48bdb97495f959606868ea58))

## [v5.0.5] - 2026-01-05 **[Release]**

> Title: "Documentation Release"

Documentation-only release. No code changes; all features documented were already present in v5.0.4.

### Comprehensive Feature Documentation

Added documentation for 8 previously undocumented feature systems (~386 lines), growing the README from ~2,026 to ~2,410 lines ([`ff5b90f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/ff5b90f91f575673a6680d8d385f9ce9bfaa739d)):

| System | What Was Documented |
|--------|---------------------|
| Safety Guards | `git_safety_guard.py` hook that blocks destructive commands |
| Agent Detection | All 12+ detected coding agents (Aider, Continue, Copilot, TabNine, Replit, etc.) |
| Type Narrowing | AST-based deep type safety for TS/JS, Rust, Kotlin, Swift |
| ast-grep Provisioning | Automatic binary download with SHA-256 verification |
| Maintenance Commands | `ubs doctor` and `ubs sessions` commands |
| Test Suite | Manifest-driven testing with `run_manifest.py` |
| Auto-Update | `--update`, `--no-auto-update`, CI mode behavior |
| Beads Integration | `--beads-jsonl` flag for issue tracking |

### Bug Fixes

- Multiple helper file bugs found via code exploration ([`61fdbde`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/61fdbdea9ab3ff4225b00319b36a50b7f9189b36))

---

## [v5.0.4] - 2026-01-05 **[Release]**

> Security patch release.

### Security: `git_safety_guard.py` Bypass Fix

**Critical:** The git safety guard could be bypassed by using absolute paths to the `rm` command (e.g., `/bin/rm -rf /important`). Added `_is_rm_command()` helper that recognizes both `rm` and any path ending in `/rm` ([`8907eec`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/8907eec8c0ca08e0c04bea467f07bb5d9ab7e65d)).

| Command | Before v5.0.4 | After v5.0.4 |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| `rm -rf /important` | Blocked | Blocked |
| `/bin/rm -rf /important` | **Allowed** (bug) | Blocked |
| `/usr/bin/rm -rf /important` | **Allowed** (bug) | Blocked |

All users of Claude Code with the `git_safety_guard.py` hook should update.

## [v5.0.0] - 2025-12-19 **[Release]**

> 105 commits, 10,600+ line additions across 50 files since v4.6.5.

### Breaking Changes

1. **ast-grep is now required** for JS/TS scanning. Install via `brew install ast-grep`, `cargo install ast-grep`, or `npm i -g @ast-grep/cli`.
2. **Exit code 2** now indicates environment errors (missing required tools), distinct from exit code 1 (findings detected).
3. **Windows paths** now parsed correctly (`C:/path:line:code`). Downstream tooling that depended on the old broken parsing may need adjustment.

### Windows Compatibility

Full Windows support via Git Bash / WSL:

- Add `.ubsignore` fallback chain when rsync unavailable: rsync -> tar -> Python ([`db01365`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/db013652d59ae2b3b3f490e446453609307a543d))

- Portable SHA-256 verification: sha256sum / shasum / openssl ([`be2dc39`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/be2dc399baf342f21535516463cb268fef83070e), [`dafce5f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/dafce5f519f47e805dbcedffcc0eee55d732056b))

### AST Accuracy Enforcement

JS/TS scanning now requires ast-grep to eliminate noisy grep-based false positives. Six key improvements:

- Enforce ast-grep; AST-confirm noisy JS/TS findings ([`a17b0f7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/a17b0f74d845ac252d8804025808dd4413a41882))

> First tagged version. Encompasses all development from the initial v4.4 commit (2025-11-16) through the polyglot architecture, 8-language module system, and full test suite.

### Multi-Language Scanner Architecture

Refactored from a monolithic JavaScript-only scanner into a modular polyglot system supporting 8 languages. Each language module runs as an independent shell script with standardized output ([`d392951`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/d392951bc2dc67bd44b5502534f67f1768c23182), [`c24548e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/commit/c24548e0da1b2916e99406701502b32e4a9a7695)).
